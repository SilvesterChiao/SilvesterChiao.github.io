## Songs

1. 寂静之声(The Sounds Of Silence)

    > Hello darkness my old friend
    >
    > love come to talk with you again
    >
    > Because a vision softly creeping
    >
    > left its seeds while I was sleeping
    >
    > And the vision
    >
    > that was planted in my brain
    >
    > Still remains
    >
    > within the sound of silence
    >
    > In restless dreams I walked alone
    >
    > narrow streets of cobblestone
    >
    > Neath the halo of a street lamp
    >
    > I turned my collar to the cold and damp
    >
    > When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
    >
    > That split the night and touched the sound of silence
    >
    > And in the naked light I saw
    >
    > ten thousand people maybe more
    >
    > People talking without speaking
    >
    > people hearing without listening
    >
    > People writing songs
    >
    > that voices never share
    >
    > No one dare disturb the sound of silence
    >
    > Fools said I you do not know silence like a cancer grows
    >
    > Hear my words that I might teach you
    >
    > take my arms that I might reach you
    >
    > But my words like silence raindrops fell
    >
    > And echoed in the wells of silence
    >
    > And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made
    >
    > And the sign flashed out its warning
    >
    > in the words that it was forming
    >
    >And the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
    >
    > And tenement halls
    >
    > and whispered in the sounds of silence
