Nineteen Eighty-Four

1984

内容简介：

Nineteen Eighty-Four《1984》描写了未来社会即1984年大洋国一个普通人的日常生活。在大洋国，权力高度集中在“党”英社的手中，到处张贴着党的领袖老大哥的画像，几乎到处都安有电屏幕，思想警察神出鬼没，人们主要指党员，无时无刻不在被监视、被监听，连自由地思想都是一种罪。主人公温斯顿在真理部从事篡改历史的工作，他对所处的社会和老大哥渐渐地产生了怀疑，在与另一名党员朱丽亚秘密恋爱后，逐渐成为思想犯，被思想警察逮捕……

Hidden away in the Record Department of the sprawling Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith skilfully rewrites the past to suit the needs of the Party. Yet he inwardly rebels against the totalitarian world he lives in, which demands absolute obedience and controls him through the all-seeing telescreens and the watchful eye of Big Brother, symbolic head of the Party. In his longing for truth and liberty, Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow-worker Julia, but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal.

To Kill a Mockingbird

杀死一只知更鸟

内容简介：

“如果可以的话，你可以去捕猎蓝鸦，但记得不要去伤害无害的知更鸟。”这样建议他的孩子们的律师芬奇同时也在保护着现实中的“知更鸟”，一个被指控强奸白人女孩但实则无辜的黑人。1930年代，在种族歧视严重、阶级等级森严的美国南部小镇，人们的良知被偏见、暴力和虚伪掩盖，而一位正直、勇敢的律师通过自己不畏强暴、艰难的伸张正义之举，唤起人们原本的善良、同情和人性美好的一面。

A lawyer’s advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee’s classic novel—a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man’s struggle for justice—but the weight of history will only tolerate so much.

Pride and Prejudice

傲慢与偏见

内容简介：

伊丽莎白出身于小地主家庭，有四个姐妹，母亲班纳特太太整天操心着为女儿物色称心如意的丈夫。新来的邻居宾利来先生和他的朋友达西打破了她们一家人单调的乡村生活。宾利来和伊丽莎白的姐姐简互生情愫；达西对善良聪明的伊丽莎白产生了好感，而伊丽莎白却对达西不可一世的傲慢心存偏见，不接受他的感情。然而，世事难料，宾利来和简因为误会，关系危在旦夕；达西的种种作为，展示了性格中和伊丽莎白相同的善良一面，逐渐赢得了伊丽莎白的好感。两对有情人能否终成眷属？班纳特姐妹们能否得到自己想要的生活？简·奥斯汀以女性的特殊视角描绘了她对爱情的观点：寻找真正爱自己的人，追求完美的爱情。

Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman, Mr Bennet, living in Longbourn.

Set in England in the late 18th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after two gentlemen have moved into their neighbourhood: the rich and eligible Mr Bingley, and his status-conscious friend, the even richer and more eligible Mr Darcy. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy is disdainful of local society and repeatedly clashes with the Bennets' lively second daughter, Elizabeth.
